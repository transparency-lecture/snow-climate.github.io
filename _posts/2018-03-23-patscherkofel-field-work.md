Today our class spent several hours digging in the snow and installing
two automatic weather stations (AWS) near a ski slope at the
[Patscherkofel ski area](http://www.patscherkofelbahn.at/de/winter#winter).

There was _a lot_ of snow, and although the day started cloudy and snowy, the
weather improved while we were working.

Setting up the stations on the uneven ground was not so easy, and required
long discussions about the best way to do it.

After several hours of work, the station were up and running. We used an
[ecobot](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4429021/) to make additional
measurements, and we took care that the skiers won't run into our station by
mistake.

The field work was a real success! We ended the day in the cosy Patscher Alm
while the stations started to send their data via the mobile network to they
university servers.
