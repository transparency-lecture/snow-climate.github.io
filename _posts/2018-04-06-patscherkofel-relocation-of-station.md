Finally the Patscherkofel ski area closed at Easter Monday and we were allowed 
to install one station on the ski slope. For this purpose two students (Lilian 
and Zora) and the lecturer Fabien went up to the stations by touring skis. Luckily 
there was still enough snow, or better ice, on the slopes, so that we could start 
from the parking space with the skis on our feet and not on the back.

We were happy to meet our stations as we left them.

After overcoming 800 metres altitude difference the real work started: How 
to get through a thick layer of extremely hard snow? With an ice axe, patience and strong muscles.

After the relocation of the station and putting all of the snow back into the hole, 
the measurement divice's sensors were cleaned. Of course the fence was moved to protect the stations 
and the skiers from each other.
