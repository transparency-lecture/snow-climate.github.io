**Welcome to this educational website!** It was built entirely by students
for the course ["Transparency and communication in Earth Sciences"](https://orawww.uibk.ac.at/public/lfuonline_lv.details?sem_id_in=18S&lvnr_id_in=707823), given at the
University of Innsbruck during the summer semester 2018.

In this lecture, the students get acquainted with several fundamental tenets of [open science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science)
in a real world application.

You can read about the outcome of their work by navigating the topics on your left
and by visiting our blog!
